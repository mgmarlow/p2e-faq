# Random Encounters

Random encounters help maintain tension when dungeon crawling, keeping things spicy. These rules pair especially well with [Tension Clocks](./tension-clocks).

## Crafting Encounters

1. Prep a list of relevant creatures beforehand, usually within 4 levels of your players. Each creature is assigned an XP value from the [Creature XP table](#creature-xp).
2. Decide on the encounter's threat level. Most random encounters should be Moderate.
3. Consult the [Encounter XP Budget](#encounter-xp-budget) table.
4. Pick monsters from step 1 until you reach the XP budget from step 3.

## Encounter XP Budget

This table provides a recommended XP budget matching the encounter's intended threat level.

This table is designed for parties with 4 players. For groups consisting of greater or fewer, add or subtract the adjustment value for each additional or missing player.

<Table
  heading={['Threat', 'XP Budget', 'Adjustment']}
  rows={[
    ['Trivial', 40, 10],
    ['Low', 60, 15],
    ['Moderate', 80, 20],
    ['Severe', 120, 30],
    ['Extreme', 160, 40],
  ]}
/>

## Creature XP

The Creature XP table assigns an XP value to a monster based on the difference between that monster's level and the party's average level (PL).

<Table
  heading={['Creature Level', 'XP', 'Suggested Role']}
  rows={[
    ['PL-4', 10, 'Low-threat Lackey'],
    ['PL-3', 15, 'Low or moderate-threat Lackey'],
    ['PL-2', 20, 'Lackey or standard creature'],
    ['PL-1', 30, 'Standard creature'],
    ['PL', 40, 'Standard creature or low-threat boss'],
    ['PL+1', 60, 'Low or moderate-threat boss'],
    ['PL+2', 80, 'Moderate or severe-threat boss'],
    ['PL+3', 120, 'Severe or extreme-threat boss'],
    ['PL+4', 160, 'Extreme-threat boss'],
  ]}
/>

## Examples

Given a party of 4 level 5 characters, a moderate encounter may look like:

- XP budget = 80XP
- Level 4 creature (30XP) + level 4 creature (30XP) + level 3 creature (20XP)

Given a party of 6 level 5 characters, a moderate encounter may look like:

- XP budget = 80XP + (2 \* 20XP) = 120XP
- Level 6 creature (60XP) + level 5 creature (40XP) + level 3 creature (20XP)
